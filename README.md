## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (recommended version: v20.17.0+)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **Expo CLI** for React Native development
- **tRPC** for type-safe API calls

### Setup

1. **Clone the mobile repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andinolabs/yiqi-mobile.git
   cd yiqi-mobile
   ```

2. **Clone the server repository (Yiqi Web):**

   Yiqi Mobile relies on a backend server. You need to set up the server as well. Clone the server repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andino-Labs/yiqi-web.git
   cd yiqi-web
   ```

   Follow the setup instructions in the server repositoryâ€™s README to get the backend up and running.

3. **Install dependencies for the mobile app:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and fill in the values as needed. You can find the necessary API URLs, client IDs, and keys in the `.env` file.

5. **Run the app locally:**

   For local development, use the following commands:

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   expo run:android / expo run:ios
   ```

6. **If you want to run on your real device:**

   For Android devices, you need to point to the server port using the following command:

   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
   ```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo for mobile app development
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes and server actions (using **tRPC** for type-safe API calls)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for login, including Google Sign-In
- **API**: tRPC for type-safe API calls from the mobile app
- **Validation**: Zod for data validation
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Email**: AWS SES
- **Payments**: Mercado Pago

## Configuration (Expo)

Ensure you add the required configurations for the mobile app before rebuilding:

### **Google Login (iOS Configuration)**

- Add your **Google login URL scheme** for iOS to enable Google authentication. This should be placed in your `app.json` as shown below:

```json
"plugins": [
  [
    "@react-native-google-signin/google-signin",
    {
      "iosUrlScheme": "com.googleusercontent.apps._some_id_here_"
    }
  ]
]
```

### **Google Maps API Key (Android/iOS)**

- Add your **Google Maps API Key** in the configuration section for Android (and iOS, if applicable):

```json
"android": {
  "config": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": "maps_api_key_here_"
    }
  }
},
"ios": {
  "config": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": "maps_api_key_here_"
    }
  }
}
```

Once these configurations are set, you can rebuild the app with Expo.
